# Excel Demo

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This is a demo application by Anthropic. It is intended for local development only and should NOT be deployed to production or used at scale.

A demonstration desktop application powered by Claude and the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk), showcasing AI-powered spreadsheet creation, analysis, and manipulation capabilities.

## What This Demo Shows

This Electron-based desktop application demonstrates how to:
- Create sophisticated Excel spreadsheets with formulas, formatting, and multiple sheets
- Analyze and manipulate existing spreadsheet data
- Use Claude to assist with data organization and spreadsheet design
- Work with Python scripts to generate complex spreadsheet structures
- Integrate the Claude Agent SDK with desktop applications

### Example Use Cases

The `agent/` folder contains Python examples including:
- **Workout Tracker**: A fitness log with automatic summary statistics and multiple sheets
- **Budget Tracker**: Financial tracking with formulas and data validation
- Custom spreadsheet generation with styling, borders, and conditional formatting

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org) or [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- An Anthropic API key ([get one here](https://console.anthropic.com))
- Python 3.9+ (for the Python agent examples)
- LibreOffice (optional, for formula recalculation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthropics/sdk-demos.git
cd sdk-demos/excel-demo
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or bun install
```

3. Configure your Anthropic API key:
   - Set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable, or
   - The application will prompt you on first run

4. Run the Electron application:
```bash
npm start
# or bun start
```

## Working with Python Examples

The `agent/` directory contains Python scripts demonstrating spreadsheet generation:

### Setup Python Environment

```bash
cd agent
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run Example Scripts

```bash
# Create a workout tracker
python create_workout_tracker.py

# Create a budget tracker
python create_budget_tracker.py
```

See the [agent/README.md](./agent/README.md) for more details on the Excel agent setup and capabilities.
