transcript evidence and every difference is plausibly ASR spelling,
capitalization, punctuation, hyphenation, word-boundary, exact-homophone, or
phonetic proper-name drift. A spelled-out number and the same value rendered as
digits are explicit equivalent evidence (for example, "twenty-four point five
million" and "24.5 million"); a genuinely changed numeric value is not. Treat
the deterministic check as a mismatch trigger, not as ground truth: its token
expansion and leading/trailing anchor fields can be false for number formatting,
punctuation, or word-boundary differences. Independently compare SOURCE TEXT
with both raw transcripts before deciding. Reject any omitted, added, repeated,
paraphrased, negated, number-changed, or entity-changed spoken content. Do not
fill a missing word from context. If the two transcripts do not provide enough
evidence, reject. Word timestamps can overlap when Whisper emits a duplicate or
hallucinated token. Treat an overlapping token as an ASR artifact only when the
other transcript does not contain it at the same content position; do not treat
the deterministic word count alone as proof of repeated speech. Return JSON
