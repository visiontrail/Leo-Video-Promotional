"""Turn a narration script plus its rendered audio into a timed storyboard.

This is the stage that used to be missing. The old composer went straight from
"script lines" to "one caption div per line", which is why a 12-minute episode
rendered as 158 stacked subtitle clips and nothing else. A storyboard sits in
between: it groups the spoken lines into *scenes* (a handful of seconds each,
cut on natural pauses) and hands every downstream consumer — the AI visual
planner, the scene-kit renderer, and the Claude Agent SDK director — the same
timing truth.

Nothing here talks to a model. Timing must be reproducible and must line up with
the audio to the frame, so segmentation is pure arithmetic over the script and
the ffmpeg silence map. The creative layer (what each scene *looks* like) is
:mod:`backend.pipeline.visual_plan`.
